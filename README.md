Here's a concise yet comprehensive README file for your Sudoku Solver WebApp:

# Sudoku Solver WebApp
# Overview
A web application built with React.js to input, validate, and solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. This app allows users to input initial Sudoku values, validate the entries, and solve the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

# Features
Input Grid: A 9x9 grid for users to input initial Sudoku values (1-9) or leave cells blank.
Validate: A button to validate the current state of inputs.
Solve: A button to solve the Sudoku puzzle if the entries are valid.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if the initial entries are invalid.

# Approach
Validation Logic
Rows Validation: Ensures each row contains unique values (excluding empty cells).
Columns Validation: Ensures each column contains unique values (excluding empty cells).
3x3 Sub-grids Validation: Ensures each 3x3 sub-grid contains unique values (excluding empty cells).

# Solving Algorithm
The solving algorithm uses a backtracking approach:

Find Empty Cell: Identifies the next empty cell in the grid.
Valid Placement Check: Checks if placing a number (1-9) in the empty cell adheres to Sudoku rules.
Recursive Solving: Attempts to solve the puzzle by placing a number and recursively solving the rest of the grid. If a conflict is found, it backtracks and tries the next number.
